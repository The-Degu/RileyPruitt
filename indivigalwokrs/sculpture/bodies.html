            <p>Breast cancer is common in my women in my family.&nbsp; Only three of us have not been diagnosed with the disease, and some of us have died. My mother thought she was sterile after her radiation treatments, but here I am. For me, it feels more like a matter of &lsquo;when&rsquo; rather then &lsquo;if&rsquo; even if I do not have the genetic predisposition for it.</p>

            <p>Ever out with your friends and go completely wild?&nbsp;Unlike how you exist at any other time. Your emotions just so much more extreme than at any other point in time, both highs and lows amplified beyond what you think is possible.&nbsp; You feel free and open though alien in your skin at the same time.</p>

            <p><strong>What is Happening?</strong></p>
            <p>3D print, paper</pf>
            <p>2017</p>
            <p>This book was created to bridge the language gap between doctors and patients. Many scary things happen in the hospital, and sometimes doctors are not the best at explaining in layman&rsquo;s terms about what may be happening. This book is aimed towards children, though it has essential information that many may find useful if they find themselves in the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
