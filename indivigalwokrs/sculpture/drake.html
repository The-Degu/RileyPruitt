            <p>This sculptural representation of the Common American Drake is actually that of Scales, the Whitehouse Pet. This presidential style bust of the animal was commissioned by the then president after her dear pet passed, and is now shown throughout the US as one of the last representations of the extinct breed.</p>

            <p>This specimen was found in off of the shore of Lake Erie, December 1997.&nbsp; After being found it was quickly brought to a local researcher who confirmed its contagion statutes. Though after further inspection it was seen that this was a long dead dropped boil from a larger mass.&nbsp; It is currently unknown how it got into the lake and regular testing of the great lakes show no sign of larger infection.</p>
