            <p><strong>Adeline Gauthier</strong></p>
            <p>When your family does not want you anymore, and you have powers, you do not know how to control where do you go? To the circus, of course! At least that is what Adeline tells herself, not the truth that she scared her parents so much that they gave her up the first moment they had the chance. Though that does not bother her so much anymore, she has a real family under the big top now, friends and freaks that know what it's like to be a little more than natural.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Aegis</strong></p>
            <p>Only built to fight, and he has only known the ring.&nbsp; Agis does not know anything beyond making his maker money in the underground matches he is sent to until one day his maker goes missing, and he is lost in the wider world. Now he has to find his way, and try to understand what the world is beyond the ring.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Eloise Kaskbow</strong></p>
            <p>Being a descendant of a god isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal when everyone would be tripping to help you anyway.&nbsp; Eloise finds herself sheltered but not unhappy for years, but when a mysterious stranger comes to her hometown, she cannot help but follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Haily</strong></p>
