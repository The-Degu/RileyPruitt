        <div class="text"><p><strong>Adeline Gauthier</strong></p>
            <p>When your family does not want you anymore, and you have powers, you do not know how to control where do you go? To the circus, of course! At least that is what Adeline tells herself, not the truth that she scared her parents so much that they gave her up the first moment they had the chance. Though that does not bother her so much anymore, she has a real family under the big top now, friends and freaks that know what it's like to be a little more than natural.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Aegis</strong></p>
            <p>Only built to fight, and he has only known the ring.&nbsp; Agis does not know anything beyond making his maker money in the underground matches he is sent to until one day his maker goes missing, and he is lost in the wider world. Now he has to find his way, and try to understand what the world is beyond the ring.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Eloise Kaskbow</strong></p>
            <p>Being a descendant of a god isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal when everyone would be tripping to help you anyway.&nbsp; Eloise finds herself sheltered but not unhappy for years, but when a mysterious stranger comes to her hometown, she cannot help but follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Hunt</strong></p>
            <p>Growing up as a half-demon is not easy but not unheard of.&nbsp;When your sister and mother are human, it tends to get a little tougher.&nbsp; Though growing up with thick skin is easy when fire flows through your veins. It is also easy to go into a mercenary work when your family needs the extra cash.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Hillape Bearhoof</strong></p>
            <p>An exercise in what would happen if a Minotaur became an undead being.&nbsp; How it may have occurred and what they may now look like.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Rosda Hollybranch</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>A cobbler&rsquo;s apprentice to feared pirate, Rosda is a woman with a long history.&nbsp; Life on the high seas is more then Roseda ever expected. Her diminutive stature does little to comfort those who he holds at sword point.&nbsp; As the first mate of the great ship Nightmere&rsquo;s revenge. She holds no bard when it comes to keeping her crew safe.</p></div>
