        <div class="text"><p><strong>The 12 races</strong></p>
            <p>In the world of Scodus the twelve races found there are the best of the best, or at least not linked to somewhere else. They exist in this world as a defiant strike against the powers working against them,&nbsp; from the huge minotaur and warforged to the diminutive gnome and Kobold each race has it&rsquo;s niche but is able to adapt beyond what their ancestors thought was possible&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Arcane Batteries: Notes and Sketches</strong></p>
            <p>In Scodus, there are many growing technologies. All of witch are biased off of the Arcane batteries.&nbsp; These are just my notes on their size and how they may work along with a few historical ideas</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>God symbols</strong></p>
            <p>With the reoccurring themes of twelve, the twelve gods of Scodus may not be cruel but are distant.&nbsp; Most of the gods have taken the mantel of the more chaotic or even evil aspects of their domain.</p></div>
