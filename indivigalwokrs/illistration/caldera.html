            <p><strong>Arcane Batteries: Notes and Sketches</strong></p>
            <p>In Scodus, there are many growing technologies. All of witch are biased off of the Arcane batteries.&nbsp; These are just my notes on their size and how they may work along with a few historical ideas</p><br>
            
            <p><strong>God symbols</strong></p>
            <p>With the reoccurring themes of twelve, the twelve gods of Scodus may not be cruel but are distant.&nbsp; Most of the gods have taken the mantel of the more chaotic or even evil aspects of their domain.</p></div>
